    <p>Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the three starter
        Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Water is the most
        common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

        As of Generation 6, Water has been paired with every other type.</p>
