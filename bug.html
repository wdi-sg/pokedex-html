    <p>Most Bug Pok√©mon grow quickly and evolve sooner than other types. As a result, they are often very weak. In
        Generation I, bugs were almost useless since the few Bug type moves available were very weak. The situation
        improved in later games with better moves and an advantage against the Dark type..</p>
