Create a pokedex document. This document is a series on inter-linked HTML pages that gives different info on pokemon.

Do some research about pokemon and their types here: [https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all)

You will be creating at least these HTML pages:

- An index page that has a list of pokemon (use the `ul` element)

- A page for each pokemon you list in the index page. (create at least 4 pages, 2 of each type) The minimum info on this page should be the name of the pokemon, a link to the page of their type, and a description paragraph, copied from the pokedex site. (you can add more info than that if you want)

- A page that lists all types of pokemon (i.e., grass, poison, etc.) - this is a list of all types included in *your* pokedex. 

- The list of all types page is linked to a page that lists the pokemon that are in that type.

The links between pages are a link tag with an `href` set to a *relative unix path*:

```
<a href="../pokemon-pages/squirtle.html">squirtle</a>
```

You should end up with a directory structure that looks like this:

- /main directory
  - /pokedex
    - squirtle.html
    - etc....
  - /index.html (list of all pokemon)
  - /types
    - /index.html (lists all types)
    - /grass.html (lists all pokemon of type grass)
    - /etc...
