    <p>There are relatively few Electric Pokémon; in fact only four were added in the third generation. Most are based
        on rodents or inanimate objects.

        Electric Pokémon are very good defensively, being weak only to Ground moves. Eelektross is the only Pokémon to
        have no type disadvantages due to its ability, Levitate.</p>
