                <h1>FAIRY TYPE</h1>

                <h5>The Fairy type was introduced in Generation 6 - the first new type for more than 12 years! Its main intention was to balance the type chart by reducing the power of dragons, while also giving an offensive boost to the Poison and Steel types. Several old Pokémon were retyped and new Pokémon introduced. In total there are just 34 Fairy type Pokémon (not including Megas/Formes), slightly above Ice.</h5>
