                <h5>Most Flying type Pokémon are based on birds or insects, along with some mythical creatures like dragons. On average they are faster than any other type.<br><br>Nearly every Flying type has Flying as the secondary type, usually with Normal. There is only one pure Flying Pokémon (Tornadus), and one line with Flying as a primary type (Noibat/Noivern). As of Generation 6, the type has also been paired with every other type.</h5>
