    <p>Ivysaur is a Grass/Poison type pokemon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Seed Pokémon. There is a bud on this pokemon’s back. To support its weight, ivysaur’s legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it’s a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.</p>
