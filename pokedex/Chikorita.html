    <p>Chikorita is a Grass type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. It is known as the Leaf Pokémon. In battle, Chikorita waves its leaf around to keep the foe at bay. However, a sweet fragrance also wafts from the leaf, becalming the battling pokemon and creating a cozy, friendly atmosphere all around.</p>
