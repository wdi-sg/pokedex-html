        <p>Combusken is a <a href="../types/fire.html">Fire</a>/<a href="../types/fighting.html">Fighting</a> type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Young Fowl Pokémon. <br><br>

        Combusken is a bipedal, chicken-like Pokémon. Most of Combusken's upper body is yellow, while most of the lower body is orange. An orange, pointed design adorns the center of its waist at the dividing line of the two colors. It has orange eyes and short, wide beak. There is a feather crest on top of its head with three orange points. This crest is smaller on female Combusken. Its tail is short and pointed. It has three, sharp claws at the ends of its long arms, and scaly, gray legs with well-developed thighs covered in shaggy feathers. <br><br>

        Because of the training Combusken does by running through its grassland habitat, these legs are capable of delivering a barrage of kicks. While it is fighting, it is noisy and produces sharp cries that distract and intimidate its opponent.</p>
