        <h3>Ponyta is a Fire type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. It is known as the Fire Horse Pokémon.

            Ponyta has a Galarian form, introduced in Pokémon Sword & Shield. It is said that they were exposed to the overflowing life energy of the Glimwood Tangle forest over many generations, and this is why their appearance became unique in the Galar region.</h3>
