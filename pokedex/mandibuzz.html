    <p>Mandibuzz is a vulture-like Pokemon, particularly resembling a turkey vulture. It has a bare, pink head and neck, along with a notched black beak and red eyes. There are black eyelashes or eyeliner-like markings above its eyes. A long brown tuft with a bone in the middle extends from the back of its head. It has a tan ruff at the base of its neck, and shaggy darker brown wings with gray tips. Mandibuzz also has shaggy brown tail feathers. Its pink feet have black talons. It has decorated itself with bones — a jaw with sharp teeth — to form a skirt. Different types of bones fall in and out of use as if there were fashion trends among Mandibuzz.
