                Slurpuff is a Fairy type Pokémon introduced in Generation 6. It is known as the Meringue Pokémon.

                Slurpuff has an unbelievable sense of smell - a hundred million times more sensitive than that of humans. With its highly attuned senses, it can distinguish the faintest of odors.
